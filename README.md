# 3DTopDownIsometricStarter

**Status: planned—perspective gameplay not implemented.**

A starting point for 3D games viewed from above or through an angled isometric-style camera. The goal is to share one player/world foundation across overhead and angled camera examples while leaving game rules and control style configurable.

## Purpose and planned direction

- Build direct keyboard/controller movement relative to the camera, with consistent speed, facing and basic animation hooks.
- Handle grounded movement, collisions, slopes and spawn/respawn. Viewing a 3D world from above does not by itself remove its vertical movement or gravity requirements.
- Add overhead and angled camera presets with follow behavior, bounds and tunable zoom. Keep both in this repository.
- Provide interaction targeting and a small test area with a slope, tall props, an interactable, a checkpoint and an exit. Test whether props obscure the player and choose a simple visibility solution.
- Connect the example to the existing menus, scene transitions and save backend, including a deliberate policy for restoring player and camera state.

Click-to-move with navigation is a possible second example after direct control works. Tactical grids, turn order, parties, RTS selection, fog of war, combat and inventory are separate game-specific extensions, not assumed requirements.

## Camera and presentation choices

Document each camera preset's intended appearance and control mapping. Overhead and angled views should share gameplay systems rather than duplicate them. Choose 3D rendering and art settings independently of the preferred pixel preset for 2D starters.

Use assigned player, camera, interaction and HUD references. Introduce navigation or camera plugins only when the example demonstrates a clear need. See the [setup guide](docs/PROJECT_SETUP.md) and [optional systems](docs/OPTIONAL_SYSTEMS.md).

## What will demonstrate readiness

Verify movement across camera presets, ramps and ledges, visibility behind props, interaction range, zoom limits and UI input isolation. Test keyboard/controller play, respawn, save/continue and a clean desktop export. If pathfinding is added, also test blocked destinations and stable stopping.

## Available now: the inherited foundation

This repository currently launches the GameFoundation menu/demo scene, not a perspective-specific game. New Game opens that demo; the player controller and camera described above are planned work.

The copied foundation includes title/pause/settings menus, keyboard and controller menu confirmation/back, scene transitions, persistent volume/fullscreen and Save-action bindings, a versioned save backend and Continue, optional UI audio, and a shared Theme. Its regression scene is included. Existing validation records describe foundation checks, not certification of this starter's future gameplay.

## Run the included foundation demo

Requirements: the .NET build of Godot 4.7.2 and .NET 8 SDK for desktop. Android configuration targets .NET 9 but has not been validated here. Gameplay movement bindings will be documented when implemented; the current controls below operate the foundation demo.

1. Import `project.godot` into the **.NET** build of Godot 4.7.2.
2. Click **Build**, then **F5**. The title scene includes Settings as a sibling menu.
3. Try New Game, Escape / controller Menu (Start, hamburger) / B, Settings, Restart, and Return to Title. Menu opens Pause during gameplay; pressing it again resumes. In Settings it returns to the previous menu.
4. In gameplay, **F5 / controller Y** saves. Return to Title and choose Continue. Settings includes a Save-action rebind button; Escape/B cancels listening.

The solution currently retains its original `Main Menu.sln` filename. This does not affect the project name or behavior.

## Assign references in the Inspector

- **Main menu:** assign its gameplay `PackedScene`, sibling `SettingsMenu`, and button nodes.
- **Pause menu:** assign its Settings menu and buttons in the gameplay scene.
- **Settings:** its controls are direct exported node fields. Renaming/rearranging UI no longer requires editing script paths.
- **Return to Title:** open `Configuration/SceneFlow.tscn`, expand `MainMenuScene`, and select a scene file. The custom `SceneReference` resource is lazy to avoid title → game → pause → title circular PackedScene dependencies.
- **Audio:** optional UI sound streams can be assigned in `addons/CoreUI/Scenes/Audio.tscn`. Empty slots are silent by design.
- **Input:** actions are defined in Project Settings → Input Map. Scripts expose `StringName` action fields. These remain names because Input Map actions are named engine identifiers.
- **Theme:** edit `addons/CoreUI/Resources/FoundationTheme.tres` or assign a replacement Theme on your menu roots.

Fields are the team convention for Inspector configuration. Godot also supports exported properties; properties are not universally unsafe.

## Ownership and dependencies

`addons/CoreUI/Scripts` and `Scenes` contain reusable code. They do not depend on example controllers. `Examples` demonstrates composition; `Configuration` holds this project's title destination. Create a `Game` folder for each real project’s scenes and scripts.

Required autoloads are preconfigured: MenuManager, SceneFlowManager, SettingsManager, AudioManager, PauseController, InputManager, SaveManager. The previously installed Phantom Camera 0.11.0.3 files and license are retained, but its editor plugin and autoload are disabled. The foundation does not require it. See `docs/OPTIONAL_SYSTEMS.md` before enabling or adding plugins.

Use `MenuManager.OpenMenu(assignedMenu)` for normal UI composition. Menu IDs and UIEventBus string opening remain an optional compatibility API; duplicate IDs produce a diagnostic. The active menu owns focus and input. Device detection does not change gameplay mouse mode; menus temporarily choose cursor visibility and restore the previous mode when closed. Title menus cannot be dismissed with Back. PauseController's manual pause is combined with menu pause requirements.

## Persistence

Preferences and keybindings share `user://settings.cfg` using read/modify/write. Bindings reload at startup. One binding per device family (keyboard/mouse or gamepad) is supported for each action. Duplicate/conflicting bindings, analog-axis rebinding UI, and a reset-to-default UI are not included.

SaveManager supports numbered slots, schema version 1, temporary-file replacement and a previous-save backup. Continue loads the saved scene. The demo saves its scene; its optional Player field can also record and restore a Node2D/Node3D position when assigned. New Game resets memory; it does not delete the previous save until the next successful save. Restart reloads the current scene and restores its last saved position when available. Each game must decide its actual checkpoint and autosave policy.

Save data strings (JSON keys, paths stored on disk), log messages, labels, and engine property names are intentional strings. Editable scene, node and menu dependencies are Inspector references.

## Development and handoff

Build and test one small playable example before expanding the feature list. The owner will validate this starter before handing it to other developers. Update this README as features move from planned to implemented, including exact controls, Inspector assignments, screenshots and limitations.

The [GDD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Om7zLuNNLW-n-AbYMff3WZQE9F3F2vL3bwv_7Om-bNg/edit) is the source of truth for scope and decisions; this README describes what this repository currently runs. The copied [starter roadmap](docs/STARTER_ROADMAP.md) is planning background and may predate repository creation. See [acceptance checks](docs/SMOKE_TESTS.md), [foundation scope](docs/FRAMEWORK_STATUS.md), and the [new-game GDD outline](docs/GDD_TEMPLATE.md).

Keep common fixes in [GameFoundation](https://github.com/JeremyMarkWilcox/GameFoundation), then deliberately bring the relevant changes into this starter and rerun its checks. Template-generated projects do not receive those changes automatically. The verified starting version is [GameFoundation b2e2268](https://github.com/JeremyMarkWilcox/GameFoundation/commit/b2e2268a29befda4821949256e8182c8b67f2c3b). See [the foundation version record](docs/FOUNDATION_VERSION.md) for the exact source, verification and update procedure.

When creating a game from this starter, rename the Godot application before saving, replace the demo with the game's own scene, and give it its own repository. Preserve third-party licenses. Add optional plugins only after checking compatibility and documenting their setup and dependencies.

## GDScript integration

Gameplay can use GDScript with the shared C# globals. See [the integration guide](docs/GDSCRIPT_INTEGRATION.md) for Inspector composition, save access, signals and the runnable example. Godot .NET and a C# build remain required.
